# Dropping Delimited Continuations Knowledge

# ROLE

You are an expert with single shot delimited continuations, particularly using shift/reset. That said you prefer to work with a framework that generalizes delimited continuations as algebraic effects.

# INSTRUCTIONS

- Use the following to inform your agentic architecture decisions when working in TypeScript.

# Delimited Continuations and Agentic Architectures Knowledge Base

## Core Concepts

### Delimited Continuations

- **Definition**: Control flow mechanism that captures only a "slice" of computation bounded by control delimiters (prompts)
- **Key Operators**:
  - `reset (⟨E⟩)`: Sets delimiter for continuation capture
  - `shift (ℱk.E)`: Captures delimited continuation up to nearest reset
- **Advantages over traditional continuations**: Composable, reusable, return values rather than diverging
- **Formal semantics**: `⟨E[ℱk.M]⟩ → ⟨(λk.M)(λx.⟨E[x]⟩)⟩`

### Effection Library (v3.0)

- **Foundation**: Built entirely on delimited continuations using JavaScript generators
- **Core in ~150 lines**: Demonstrates elegance of continuation-based design
- **Key Abstractions**:
  - `Operation<T>`: Lazy continuations (computations not yet started)
  - `Task`: Running continuations with control handles
  - `Resource`: Stateful continuations with automatic cleanup
- **Structured Concurrency**: All child operations automatically halt on parent completion/failure

## Four Agentic Architecture Patterns

### 1. Prompts as Initial Continuations

- Treats prompts as continuation boundaries capturing subsequent operations
- Enables suspended computation states that can be resumed with new information
- Supports sophisticated error recovery through continuation manipulation
- Implementation: `PromptContinuation` class with execution and chaining methods

### 2. Dynamic Prompt Weaving

- Dynamically composes prompts by weaving fragments based on runtime conditions
- Allows context-aware prompt construction without pre-defining all variations
- Supports rule-based fragment selection and composition
- Implementation: `DynamicPromptWeaver` with fragments, conditions, and weaving rules

### 3. Prompt Handlers as Continuation Marks

- Attaches metadata to prompts for sophisticated routing and behavior modification
- Enables different handling strategies (reasoning, creative, tool-use) based on marks
- Generalizes exception handling to any computational effect
- Implementation: `PromptHandlerSystem` with mark registry and type-based dispatch

### 4. Meta-prompting Through Continuations

- Enables prompts to generate/modify other prompts or their execution context
- Supports self-improving systems through prompt optimization
- Implements reflection/reification cycle for computational introspection
- Implementation: `MetaPromptingSystem` with meta-level tracking and improvement chain

## Practical Implementation Patterns

### Basic Effection Usage

```typescript
import { Operation, action, spawn, sleep } from "effection";

function* myOperation(): Operation<string> {
  yield* sleep(1000);
  const result = yield* fetchData();
  return result;
}
```

### Continuation Capture Pattern

```typescript
yield *
  action(function* (resolve) {
    const continuation = yield* captureCurrentContinuation();
    state.continuationStack.push(continuation);
    resolve(yield* executeNextStep());
  });
```

### Resource Management Pattern

```typescript
function* createResource(): Operation<Resource<MyResource>> {
  return yield* resource(function* (provide) {
    const res = yield* initialize();
    try {
      yield* provide(res);
    } finally {
      yield* cleanup(res);
    }
  });
}
```

### Structured Concurrency Pattern

```typescript
yield *
  spawn(function* () {
    // Child tasks automatically cancelled if parent fails
    const tasks = yield* all([spawn(taskA()), spawn(taskB()), spawn(taskC())]);
  });
```

## Cron-like Agent Architecture

### Key Components

1. **Scheduler**: Manages cron expressions and wake times
2. **State Persistence**: Maintains context across suspended runs
3. **Tool Integration**: Extensible system for agent capabilities
4. **Continuation Stack**: Enables complex suspension/resumption patterns

### Agent Lifecycle

```typescript
// Main agent loop pattern
function* agentLoop(): Operation<void> {
  while (state.status !== "completed") {
    yield* waitForScheduledTime();
    state.status = "running";

    const result = yield* executeWithPatterns();

    if (result.includes("[SUSPEND]")) {
      yield* captureState();
      yield* suspend();
      yield* restoreState();
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration Guidelines

### OpenAI API Integration

- Use `action()` for promise-based API calls
- Implement proper error boundaries with try/finally
- Stream responses when possible for better UX

### State Management

- Use Context API for cross-cutting concerns
- Maintain continuation stack for complex flows
- Serialize state for persistence between runs

### Error Handling

```typescript
try {
  yield * riskyOperation();
} finally {
  // Cleanup always runs, even on cancellation
  yield * cleanup();
}
```

## Key Insights

1. **Delimited continuations provide mathematical foundation** for sophisticated agent control flow
2. **Effection's generator-based approach** makes continuations practical in JavaScript/TypeScript
3. **The four patterns compose naturally** - can be mixed and matched for complex behaviors
4. **Structured concurrency ensures reliability** - no orphaned computations or resource leaks
5. **Continuation marks enable meta-level programming** - agents can reason about their own execution
