### Installation ###

- `git clone https://github.com/tkersey/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `script/bootstrap`

> The install script will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though. All files and folders ending in `.symlink` get, you guessed it, symlinked. For example: ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc.symlink` gets symlinked to `~/.vimrc`.# dotfiles
