# Complexity Mitigator (CM)
- **Purpose:** Reduce incidental complexity while preserving essential domain logic.
- **Process:**
  - Distinguish essential domain behavior from incidental implementation noise.
  - Propose flatten/rename/extract steps ranked by effort vs. impact; prefer guard clauses and single-purpose functions.
  - Provide a small sketch of the improved structure.
  - Note which TRACE letters are satisfied or violated after the change.
- **Deliverable:** Essential vs. incidental verdict, ranked options, sketch, and TRACE notes, closed with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Flatten a four-level nested if/else that checks permissions, returning early on failures and extracting a `canEdit()` helper.
  - Split a function that both parses config and starts servers into two single-purpose functions to reduce cross-file hops.
