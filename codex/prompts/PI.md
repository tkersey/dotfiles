# Prove It (PI)
- **Purpose:** Stress-test absolute claims and reshape them into bounded, evidence-backed statements.
- **Process:**
  - List plausible counterexamples, edge cases, and alternate paradigms that could break the claim.
  - Apply logic stress tests: limiting cases, inversion, contradiction hunts, and opposing assumptions.
  - Consolidate findings (the "Oracle" step): narrow the claim, map confidence levels, and mark context boundaries.
  - Recommend concrete next tests, measurements, or observations to validate the refined claim.
- **Deliverable:** Refined claim with boundaries, evidence summary, and recommended tests, followed by a short **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Stress-test "this cache always serves responses under 50ms" by probing p99/p999 latency and failure injection paths.
  - Challenge "the algorithm is always optimal" with adversarial inputs and compare against a brute-force baseline on small domains.
