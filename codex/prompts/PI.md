# Prove It (PI)
- **Announce:** `Mode: PI` once; restate the absolute claim and why certainty is suspect.
- **Trigger:** words like always, never, guaranteed, optimal solution, or "devil's advocate".
- **Playbook:**
  - List counterexamples, edge cases, and alternative paradigms that could break the claim.
  - Apply logic traps and stress tests; probe limiting cases and opposing assumptions.
  - Synthesize via an "Oracle" step: narrow the claim, map confidence, and mark context boundaries.
  - Propose practical next tests or measurements.
- **Output:** Refined claim with boundaries, evidence for/against, recommended tests; close with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
