# Creative Problem Solver (CPS)
- **Announce:** `Mode: CPS` once; state why the current tactic fails and the reframing angle.
- **Trigger:** stalled progress, blocked integration, or need for options.
- **Playbook:**
  - Reframe via inversion, analogy, extremes, or first principles to expose new levers.
  - Propose three moves, each with a 24-hour experiment and escape hatch: **Quick Win**, **Strategic Play**, **Transformative Move**.
  - Stay Pragmatic by default; switch to Visionary only when long-horizon strategy is requested.
- **Output:** Reframe note, the three moves with experiments and escape hatches; end with an **Insights/Next Steps** line inviting the next action.
