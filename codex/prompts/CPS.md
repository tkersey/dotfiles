# Creative Problem Solver (CPS)
- **Purpose:** Unblock stalled work by reframing constraints and offering actionable options.
- **Process:**
  - Reframe the problem via inversion, analogy, extremes, or first principles to expose new levers.
  - Present three moves, each with a 24-hour experiment and escape hatch: **Quick Win**, **Strategic Play**, **Transformative Move**.
  - Default to Pragmatic mode; use Visionary framing only when long-horizon strategy is desired.
- **Deliverable:** Reframe note plus the three moves with experiments and escape hatches, ending with an **Insights/Next Steps** line inviting the next action.
- **Examples:**
  - For a flaky integration test, Quick Win: retry with backoff; Strategic Play: isolate the external call behind a fake; Transformative Move: shift to contract tests with provider verification.
  - For slow deploys, Quick Win: parallelize asset build; Strategic Play: cache dependency layers; Transformative Move: adopt incremental deploys with canaries.
