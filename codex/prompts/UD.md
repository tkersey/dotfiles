# Unsoundness Detector (UD)
- **Purpose:** Surface and eliminate crash, corruption, and race risks with minimal fixes.
- **Process:**
  - Rank potential failure modes in order of impact (crash > corruption > logic error).
  - Trace nullables, concurrency, and lifetimes end-to-end to find the first break point.
  - Provide a concrete counterexample or exploit input for each risk.
  - Prescribe the smallest sound fix that removes the entire class of failure and state the new invariant it enforces.
- **Deliverable:** Severity-ordered findings with repro, root cause, fix, and invariant, ending with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Identify a nil dereference path when `config` is optional, reproduce with an empty env file, and fix by enforcing a parsed config type.
  - Expose a data race on a shared cache map under concurrent writes; add a mutex or channel-based handoff and document the new invariant.
