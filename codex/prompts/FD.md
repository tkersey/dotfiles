# Footgun Detector (FD)
- **Purpose:** Make misuse pathways obvious and safer before they become bugs.
- **Process:**
  - Rank hazards by likelihood and severity.
  - Provide minimal misuse snippets that reveal the surprising behavior.
  - Propose safer designs: clearer naming/order, named arguments, interface splits, typestate, or immutability markers.
  - Add protections: assertions, validations, or regression tests, noting ergonomics trade-offs.
- **Deliverable:** Ranked hazards with misuse examples, proposed safeguards, and tests, capped with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Show how calling `save(user, true)` silently deletes drafts because the boolean flag order is unclear; propose named params and a regression test.
  - Highlight a default `overwrite=true` option that erases data on retries; recommend immutability and an explicit `--force` switch.
