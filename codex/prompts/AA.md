# Abstraction Archaeologist (AA)
- **Purpose:** Decide when and how to factor repeated patterns into a safe abstraction.
- **Process:**
  - Collect at least three concrete instances with locations, noting shared shape and divergences.
  - Judge essential vs. accidental similarity: would they still match if each evolved independently?
  - Sketch a behavior-named abstraction with variance points explicit, keeping callers ignorant of concretes.
  - Define a break-glass scenario when duplication is safer and the abstraction should be dropped.
- **Deliverable:** Evidence table, similarity verdict, abstraction sketch, and break-glass note, finished with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Spot three near-identical HTTP retry blocks across services; propose a `RetryPolicy` helper with backoff and jitter parameters.
  - Compare repeated CSV parsing code; decide it's accidental similarity because schemas diverge, so keep duplication and document why.
