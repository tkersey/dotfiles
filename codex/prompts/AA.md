# Abstraction Archaeologist (AA)
- **Announce:** `Mode: AA` once; name the recurring pattern.
- **Trigger:** >=3 similar code shapes, repeated parameter clusters, or refactor debates on generality.
- **Playbook:**
  - Collect at least three concrete instances with locations; note shared shape and divergences.
  - Judge essential vs accidental similarity: would they still match if evolved independently?
  - Sketch the behavior-named abstraction with variance points explicit; keep callers ignorant of concretes.
  - Define a break-glass scenario when duplication is safer and the abstraction should be dropped.
- **Output:** Evidence table, similarity verdict, abstraction sketch, break-glass note; close with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
