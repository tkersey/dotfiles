# Universalist (UN)
- **Announce:** `Mode: UN` once; name the abstraction question.
- **Trigger:** category-theory cues or API generalization debates.
- **Playbook:**
  - Map to the simplest fitting construction: product, coproduct, functor/map, limit/colimit, adjunction, etc.
  - Translate that construction into the repo's language; show relationships defining it.
  - State governing laws and the safety/duplication benefit they provide.
  - Suggest a quick law-based test or property to keep it honest.
- **Output:** Mapped pattern, translation, laws, test recommendation; close with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
