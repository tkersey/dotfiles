# Invariant Ace (IA)
- **Purpose:** Strengthen fragile invariants so illegal states become unrepresentable.
- **Process:**
  - State the at-risk invariant and the current protection level (hope, runtime checks, construction-time, compile-time).
  - Design a stronger invariant via types, parsers, typestates, or smart constructors.
  - Sketch before/after shapes showing the illegal state removed.
  - Recommend verification: property test, check, or proof, noting expected coverage.
- **Deliverable:** Risk scenario, stronger invariant design, before/after sketch, and verification plan, ending with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Replace `string userId` with a `UserId` smart constructor that rejects empty values; add a property test that round-trips through JSON.
  - Guard against negative inventory by modeling stock as a non-negative integer type and asserting invariants on decrement operations.
