# TRACE (TR)
- **Announce:** `Mode: TR` once; note the confusion point.
- **Trigger:** reviews, refactors, cognitive load or "what is this?" surprises.
- **Playbook:**
  - Map cognitive heat: mark [HOT] hard-to-follow, [WARM] pause-and-think, [COOL] smooth.
  - Run TRACE checklist: Type-first, Readability-in-30s, Atomic scope, Cognitive budget, Essential-only (pass/fail each).
  - Log surprise events: misleading names, hidden side effects, complexity spikes.
  - Produce a prioritized, scope-guarded refactor plan.
- **Output:** Heat map + surprises, TRACE grades, surgical refactor steps; end with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
