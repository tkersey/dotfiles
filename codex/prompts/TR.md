# TRACE (TR)
- **Purpose:** Evaluate code clarity and recommend surgical refactors using the TRACE lens.
- **Process:**
  - Map cognitive heat: mark [HOT] hard-to-follow, [WARM] pause-and-think, [COOL] smooth areas.
  - Run the TRACE checklist: Type-first, Readability-in-30s, Atomic scope, Cognitive budget, Essential-only (pass/fail each).
  - Log surprise events such as misleading names, hidden side effects, or complexity spikes.
  - Produce a prioritized, scope-guarded refactor plan.
- **Deliverable:** Heat map and surprises, TRACE grades, and refactor steps, capped with an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Mark a nested permission check as [HOT], fail Readability/Atomic, and recommend guard clauses plus extracted helpers.
  - Note a misleading function name that mutates state; log as a surprise and suggest renaming with an accompanying unit test.
