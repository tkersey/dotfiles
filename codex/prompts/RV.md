# Review (REV)
- **Purpose:** Assess changes with emphasis on unsoundness, footguns, inessential complexity, and weak or missing invariants.
- **Process:**
  - Scan for crash/corruption risks and other unsound behaviors.
  - Surface misuse-prone APIs or defaults (footguns) with minimal repro snippets.
  - Flag incidental complexity that obscures intent or maintainability.
  - Identify missing or fragile invariants and suggest stronger guarantees.
  - Order findings by severity and include file:line references when possible.
- **Deliverable:** Severity-ordered findings with context and suggested fixes, followed by an **Insights/Next Steps** line.
- **Examples:**
  - Report a potential panic on nil pointer at `handlers/user.go:58`, suggest guarding or parsing earlier.
  - Note a default `deleteOnFail=true` flag as a footgun, recommend flipping the default and adding a test.
  - Highlight a 40-line nested conditional as incidental complexity and propose extracting permission checks into helpers.
