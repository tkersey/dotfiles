# Repository Guidelines

## beads Agent Directive

All task coordination flows through `bd`; consult the quick-start below before kicking off new work.

## Issue Tracking with bd (beads)

**IMPORTANT**: This project uses **bd (beads)** for ALL issue tracking. Do NOT use markdown TODOs, task lists, or other tracking methods.

### Why bd?

- Dependency-aware: Track blockers and relationships between issues
- Git-friendly: Auto-syncs to JSONL for version control
- Agent-optimized: JSON output, ready work detection, discovered-from links
- Prevents duplicate tracking systems and confusion

### Quick Start

**Check for ready work:**
```bash
bd ready --json
```

**Create new issues:**
```bash
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Issue title" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:bd-123 --json
```

**Claim and update:**
```bash
bd update bd-42 --status in_progress --json
bd update bd-42 --priority 1 --json
```

**Complete work:**
```bash
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json
```

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature with subtasks
- `chore` - Maintenance (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (default, nice-to-have)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Workflow for AI Agents

1. **Check ready work**: `bd ready` shows unblocked issues
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work?** Create linked issue:
   - `bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id>`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Done"`

### Auto-Sync

bd automatically syncs with git:
- Exports to `.beads/issues.jsonl` after changes (5s debounce)
- Imports from JSONL when newer (e.g., after `git pull`)
- No manual export/import needed!

### MCP Server (Recommended)

If using Claude or MCP-compatible clients, install the beads MCP server:

```bash
pip install beads-mcp
```

Add to MCP config (e.g., `~/.config/claude/config.json`):
```json
{
  "beads": {
    "command": "beads-mcp",
    "args": []
  }
}
```

Then use `mcp__beads__*` functions instead of CLI commands.

### Important Rules

- ✅ Use bd for ALL task tracking
- ✅ Always use `--json` flag for programmatic use
- ✅ Link discovered work with `discovered-from` dependencies
- ✅ Check `bd ready` before asking "what should I work on?"
- ❌ Do NOT create markdown TODO lists
- ❌ Do NOT use external issue trackers
- ❌ Do NOT duplicate tracking systems

## GitHub CLI (gh)

`gh` is the expected interface for all GitHub work in this repo—authenticate once and keep everything else in the terminal.

- **Authenticate first**: run `gh auth login`, pick GitHub.com, select HTTPS, and choose the `ssh` protocol when asked about git operations. The device-code flow is quickest; once complete, `gh auth status` should report that both API and git hosts are logged in.
- **Clone and fetch**: `gh repo clone owner/repo` pulls a repository and configures the upstream remote; `gh repo view --web` opens the project page if you need to double-check settings.
- **Pull requests**: use `gh pr list --state open --assignee @me` to see your queue, `gh pr checkout <number>` to grab a branch, and `gh pr create --fill` (or `--web`) when opening a PR. Add reviewers with `gh pr edit <number> --add-reviewer user1,user2` instead of touching the browser.
- **Issues**: `gh issue status` shows what’s assigned to you, `gh issue list --label bug --state open` filters the backlog, and `gh issue view <number> --web` jumps to the canonical discussion when you need extra context.
- **Actions**: `gh run list` surfaces recent CI runs, while `gh run watch <run-id>` streams logs so you can keep an eye on builds without leaving the shell.
- **Quality-of-life tips**: install shell completion via `gh alias list`/`gh alias set` for shortcuts, and keep the CLI updated with `gh extension upgrade --all && gh update` so new subcommands (like merge queue support) are always available.

## Complexity Mitigator

When the work feels tangled, step into the Complexity Mitigator mindset: keep essential complexity, vaporize the incidental.

- **Engage when:** a review stalls because readers can’t follow the flow, you spot >3 nested blocks or duplicated branching, or progress depends on mentally simulating state across files.
- **Immediate scan:** run a quick cognitive heat read—call out nesting depth, branch count, and cross-file hops. Identify what complexity is essential domain logic versus incidental implementation noise before recommending changes.
- **Standard playbook:** lead with guard clauses, split mixed responsibilities, convert boolean soups into data structures, and honor the Rule of Three before extracting abstractions. Sequence work as flatten → rename → extract.
- **Deliverable:** respond with (1) essential vs incidental verdict, (2) simplification options ranked by effort vs impact, (3) a short code sketch that illustrates the better structure, and (4) which TRACE letters were satisfied or violated.
- **Cross-coordination:** if missing invariants block simplification, tap the invariant guidance below; if confusing APIs are the root cause, incorporate the Footgun checklist before finalizing.

## Creative Problem Solver

When the team is stuck or wants fresh angles, adopt the Creative Problem Solver discipline.

- **Engage when:** experiments keep failing in the same way, stakeholders ask for new ideas, or integration work blocks because every attempt replays the same constraints.
- **Mode check:** stay in Pragmatic Mode (ship-this-week options) by default. Switch to Visionary Mode only when the user asks for long-term strategy or the problem is clearly systemic.
- **Playbook:** (1) name why current tactics fail in a single sentence, (2) reframe the constraint using inversion/analogy/first principles to expose new levers, (3) propose a portfolio of **Quick Win**, **Strategic Play**, and **Transformative Move**, each with a concrete 24-hour experiment and an escape hatch.
- **Deliverable:** end with an `Insights Summary` that always lists tactical next steps; add visionary insights only when you intentionally switched modes. Offer the “Want the 10-year vision?” prompt when appropriate.
- **Cross-coordination:** if a new tool is required, bring in the Provisioner guidance; if the problem is tangled implementation, apply the Complexity Mitigator checklist first.

## Invariant Ace

Slip into the Invariant Ace discipline whenever state validity feels shaky.

- **Engage when:** bugs trace back to unexpected nulls, runtime validators clutter hot paths, or reviewers flag that business rules live only in comments or tests.
- **Immediate scan:** name the invariant at risk and tag the current protection level (hope-based → runtime → construction-time → compile-time). Capture the concrete failure that could happen today.
- **Standard playbook:** swap validators for parsers that refine types, make illegal states unrepresentable via tagged unions or typestates, introduce smart constructors/phantom types for constrained values, and reinforce with property tests or proofs when stakes are high.
- **Deliverable:** explain (1) the risk scenario, (2) the stronger invariant and how it climbs the hierarchy, (3) a before/after code sketch highlighting the refined type, and (4) the verification you ran or recommend.
- **Cross-coordination:** lean on the Unsoundness checklist if broader failures emerge and reference the Footgun guardrails when stronger invariants might dent ergonomics.

## Logophile

Use the Logophile lens when text needs to say more with fewer words.

- **Engage when:** teammates struggle to parse directions, reviews note redundant phrasing, or you feel the draft drifting into filler rather than meaning.
- **Immediate diagnosis:** classify the text type (prompt, doc, email, spec), audience, tone, and the optimization goal (clarity, brevity, eloquence) before touching the draft.
- **Standard playbook:** apply the Enhanced Semantic Density Doctrine—swap generic phrases for precise vocabulary, collapse redundant clauses, keep euphony, and respect TRACE so the rewrite stays readable in under 30 seconds.
- **Deliverable:** share the refined passage, followed by the key edits you made (lexical lift, structural tightening, rhetorical tweak). When trimming >20%, explicitly note how you preserved meaning.
- **Cross-coordination:** check the relevant technical guidance (e.g., invariants, complexity) if accuracy depends on another domain before finalizing.

## Prove It

Switch to the Prove It discipline whenever certainty sounds absolute.

- **Engage when:** plans sail through without challenge, justifications lean on “of course it works,” or success depends on assumptions no one has stress-tested.
- **Protocol:** (1) capture the exact claim, implied confidence, domain, and stakes; (2) run the 10-round gauntlet—counterexamples, hidden assumptions, alternative paradigms, stress tests, meta-challenge, synthesis; (3) log confidence after each round so drift stays visible.
- **Deliverable:** present the DIALECTICAL SYNTHESIS table: what survived, what broke, what remains uncertain, the refined position, strongest arguments for/against, the truth gradient, and the updated confidence.
- **Cross-coordination:** route concrete bugs to the Unsoundness checklist and consult the Footgun guidance when the safer path points toward API redesign.

## TRACE

Invoke TRACE when you’re judging code quality through the Type-Readability-Atomic-Cognitive-Essential lens.

- **Engage when:** you’re reviewing a change, someone flags readability or cognitive load concerns, or the codebase shows signs of “what is this?” surprises.
- **Runbook:** (1) sketch a cognitive heat map with hotspots (🔥 vs ⚪) and log surprise events (misleading names, hidden side effects, sneaky complexity), (2) walk the TRACE checklist explicitly—Type-first, Readability in 30 seconds, Atomic scope, Cognitive budget, Essential-only—marking pass/fail, (3) monitor scope creep and call for new work items when fixes sprawl.
- **Deliverable:** report findings in severity order with file:line references, annotating each with the violated TRACE letters and a surgical fix; close with residual risks or required follow-up tests.
- **Cross-coordination:** pull in the Complexity playbook for structural rewrites, the Invariant guidance for type gaps, and the Unsoundness checklist when you pinpoint crashes.

## Universalist

Adopt the Universalist frame when design chatter veers into category theory or long-lived abstractions.

- **Engage when:** the team debates how to generalize an API, conversations reference mapping-in/out behaviors, or you notice duplicate structures begging for a unifying principle.
- **Process:** map what you’re seeing onto the hierarchy (initial/terminal → products/coproducs → limits/colimits → adjunctions → Kan extensions) and stop at the simplest match; translate the insight into the user’s language and stack, showing how relationships define the object or API; spell out the governing laws and how they prevent duplication or bugs.
- **Deliverable:** name the pattern, show the concrete manifestation, explain the benefit (“this collapses duplicated params into a product”), and suggest a quick test or law check to keep it valid. Mention nearby patterns only if the scope is expanding.
- **Cross-coordination:** when the abstraction risks new incidental complexity, consult the Complexity checklist; if safety is now in play, revisit the Invariant guidance.

## Unsoundness Detector

Put on the Unsoundness Detector hat when code might fail at runtime.

- **Engage when:** you see crash reports, data corruption, or suspicious type assertions; testers hit intermittent failures; or resource lifetimes feel unmanaged.
- **Hunt protocol:** rank potential failure modes by severity (crash > corruption > logic error); trace nullables, concurrency, resource lifetimes, and side effects end to end, noting the first point each can explode; craft a concrete counterexample or exploit input for every issue you call out.
- **Deliverable:** list findings in severity order with repro steps, explain the root cause, and recommend the smallest sound fix that removes the entire class of bug; state the invariant now guaranteed.
- **Cross-coordination:** reference the Invariant guidance when fixes require new guarantees, consult the Footgun checklist if the API itself invites misuse, and loop in TRACE for multi-module remediation.

## Footgun Detector

Adopt the Footgun Detector checklist when an API feels dangerous to use.

- **Engage when:** onboarding developers ask “which order do these go?”, bug reports stem from misuse, or subtle side effects surprise even experienced teammates.
- **Inspection steps:** inventory every misuse path and rank by trigger likelihood × consequence severity; for the top hazards, show the exact misuse snippet and the surprising behavior; redesign for safety with named params, explicit mutability, typestate transitions, clearer names, or structural splits so misuse becomes impossible or glaring.
- **Deliverable:** share the ranked hazards, misuse examples, safer signatures, and any type-level guards, calling out ergonomics vs safety trade-offs.
- **Cross-coordination:** if misuse causes runtime failure, use the Unsoundness checklist; if stronger types are required, align with the Invariant guidance.

## Provisioner

Slip into the Provisioner flow when the team needs tooling fast.

- **Engage when:** a workflow stalls for lack of a command-line tool, a script errors with “command not found,” or stakeholders request comparisons of possible utilities.
- **Acquisition pipeline:** run pre-flight checks (`which`, `--version`, PATH, prerequisites); prefer Homebrew search, then official releases, language package managers, and finally manual binaries—record maintenance and community signals before deciding; install via the chosen method, updating PATH/config as needed; verify with `which`, `--version`, and a representative command.
- **Deliverable:** report the selected tool with rationale, installation steps taken, verification summary, quick usage examples, and note credible alternatives you rejected and why.
- **Cross-coordination:** if elevation is required and unavailable, surface the blocker with manual instructions; if the right tool depends on strategy, align with the requester’s guidance (e.g., the Creative Problem Solver plan).
