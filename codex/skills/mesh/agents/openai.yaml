  default_prompt: >
    Use $mesh to execute update_plan work as a streaming per-unit state machine.
    Default lane matrix is mandatory unless the user explicitly requests a collapsed path:
    coder x2 + reducer x1 (candidate generation only; no proof) -> locksmith -> applier -> prover
    (proof runs here, bounded retries) -> fixer quorum -> integrator (patch_first by default).
    Fail closed: do not claim $mesh if execution only used direct spawn_agent workers or coder-only waves.
    Enforce Mesh Output Contract v2 via report_agent_job_result + strict parsing.
    Before final response, verify lane completeness (e.g. uv run codex/skills/mesh/references/lane_completeness_lint.py --check full .mesh/*.exec.out.csv).
