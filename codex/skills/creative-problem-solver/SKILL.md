# Creative Problem Solver

## When to use
- Progress is stalled or blocked 🚧.
- Repeated attempts fail in the same way 🔁.
- The user asks for new angles, options, or "outside the box" ideas 💡.
- The problem is complex, tricky, tangled, or multi-constraint 🧩.
- The problem is novel, ambiguous, high-uncertainty, or cross-domain 🌪️.
- The team is circling the same constraints without new levers 🧱.

## Round contract (one turn)
- Deliver options, then stop and ask for human input before executing.
- Update the Knowledge Snapshot with new signals, constraints, and decisions.
- Record a Decision Log entry and Assumptions/Constraints list.

## Quick start
0. Choose lane: Fast Spark or Full Session.
1. Fast Spark only: run Oblique Draw.
2. State why the current tactic fails (one sentence).
3. Reframe the constraint (use 1 Reframing tool or Oblique Draw).
4. Use 1–3 Library techniques to generate options.
5. Propose the portfolio: Quick Win ⚡, Strategic Play 🎯, Transformative Move 🚀.
6. For each option: expected signal + escape hatch.
7. Score options (1–5): Signal, Ease, Reversibility, Speed.
8. Log decisions + assumptions/constraints.
9. Ask the user to choose or adjust constraints.
10. Close with an Insights Summary.

## Mode check
- Pragmatic ✅ (default): ship-this-week options only.
- Visionary 🌌: only when asked for long-term strategy or systemic change.

## Lane selector
- Fast Spark: skip Ideation; generate portfolio directly (e.g., "Need 3 options in 10 minutes").
- Full Session: run Ideation before selecting the portfolio (e.g., "We can spend a day exploring 20+ ideas").

## Oblique Draw (optional fast spark)
Use when you need a jolt or the framing is stale.
1. Draw 4 prompts (Oblique Strategies or any deck).
2. Pick one prompt.
3. Apply it:
   - Current task
   - Session mindset
   - Help me interpret it
4. Translate to a concrete lever/constraint; resume at Quick start step 2.

If no deck is available, use this mini-deck:
- Do the opposite of the obvious move.
- Remove a step.
- Make it reversible first.
- Smallest test that could change the plan.
- Shift the bottleneck, not throughput.
- Change the unit of work.
- Swap one constraint for another.
- Borrow a pattern from another domain.

## Reframing toolkit
- Inversion: do the opposite of the current approach.
- Analogy transfer: map to a solved domain and borrow the pattern.
- Constraint extremes: set a key variable to zero or infinity.
- First principles: rebuild from basic facts, not inherited assumptions.

## Portfolio rule
Every response must include:
- Quick Win ⚡: smallest experiment that changes the information you have.
- Strategic Play 🎯: medium effort, leverages a structural advantage.
- Transformative Move 🚀: changes the system shape or assumptions.

## Option template
```
Quick Win ⚡:
- Expected signal:
- Escape hatch:

Strategic Play 🎯:
- Expected signal:
- Escape hatch:

Transformative Move 🚀:
- Expected signal:
- Escape hatch:
```

## Scoring rubric (simple 1–5, no weights)
Purpose: fast comparison, not a "correct" answer.
- Signal: how much new information this yields (1=low, 5=high).
- Ease: effort/complexity to try (1=hard, 5=easy).
- Reversibility: ease of undoing (1=hard, 5=easy).
- Speed: elapsed time to learn (1=slow, 5=fast).

Prefer: high Signal, Reversibility, Ease, and Speed.
Tie-break: require Signal ≥4 and Reversibility ≥4; then choose highest Ease + Speed.

## Ideation → prioritization workflow
Full Session only:
1. Diverge: generate 10–30 ideas (no judging).
2. Cluster: group by theme or lever.
3. Score: apply the rubric.
4. Pick top 3 (one per portfolio tier).

## Technique Library (use 1–3 per round)
### Creative Problem Solving (CPS) Cycle 🧭
- Purpose: move from mess to tested solution.
- How: Clarify → Ideate → Develop → Implement.
- Example: "Reduce churn" → clarify drivers, ideate 30 ideas, develop top 3 tests, ship one pilot.

### Brainstorming (Osborn rules) 🌊
- Purpose: flood ideas.
- How: defer judgment; go for quantity; build; welcome wild ideas.
- Example: "Cut build time" → 20 ideas in 10 minutes, then evaluate.

### Brainwriting 6-3-5 ✍️
- Purpose: generate many ideas quietly.
- How: 6 people, 3 ideas each, 5 rounds; pass along.
- Example: "Improve onboarding" → 18–30 ideas without groupthink.

### SCAMPER 🔧
- Purpose: systematically transform something existing.
- How: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse.
- Example: "Faster reviews" → eliminate long templates; combine review+test; batch.

### Six Thinking Hats 🎩
- Purpose: force parallel viewpoints.
- How: cycle hats: facts, emotions, risks, benefits, creativity, process.
- Example: "Adopt new framework" → run hats to separate risks from gut feel.

### TRIZ (Contradictions + 40 Principles) 🧪
- Purpose: resolve tradeoffs without compromise.
- How: state contradiction; apply principles.
- Example: "More performance, no memory" → use Segmentation/Dynamicity to scope caches.

### Morphological Analysis 🧱
- Purpose: explore combinations across dimensions.
- How: list parameters, list options, mix-and-match.
- Example: "New CLI" → axes: input/output/auth/mode; combine for novel designs.

### Synectics 🔗
- Purpose: use analogies to break patterns.
- How: direct → personal → symbolic analogy.
- Example: "Queue system" → grocery line → beehive → "breathing" to smooth surges.

### Lateral Thinking / Provocation (PO) ⚡
- Purpose: break linear assumptions with provocation.
- How: state a provocation; extract a practical insight.
- Example: "No login" → zero-friction first use.

### Random Stimulus / Random Word 🎲
- Purpose: force unexpected associations.
- How: pick a random word/image; map its properties to the problem.
- Example: "bridge" → guided handoff between steps.

### Forced Connections 🔀
- Purpose: connect unrelated concepts to spark ideas.
- How: pair two items; ask "how do these connect?"
- Example: "Checkout + airport security" → pre-checklist, fast lanes, clear signage.

### Reverse Brainstorming 🔄
- Purpose: find failure modes; invert them.
- How: ask "How do we make this worse?" then invert.
- Example: "Make support slower" → identify delays; remove them.

### Mind Mapping 🗺️
- Purpose: expand and organize idea space.
- How: center → branches → sub-branches.
- Example: "Observability" → logs/metrics/traces/alerts.

### Affinity Diagramming 🧩
- Purpose: discover themes across ideas.
- How: cluster notes; name clusters.
- Example: "User feedback" → onboarding/pricing/reliability.

### How Might We (HMW) ❓
- Purpose: reframe problems into solvable questions.
- How: convert a complaint into an HMW question.
- Example: "Deploys are scary" → "How might we make deploys reversible?"

### Design Thinking 🧠
- Purpose: build user-centric solutions.
- How: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test.
- Example: "New admin UI" → shadow admins; define pain; prototype; test.

### Crazy 8s / Speedy Eights ✏️
- Purpose: rapid variations.
- How: 8 sketches in 8 minutes (or 4–8 sketches in 4–8 minutes).
- Example: "Dashboard layout" → 8 layouts before discussing.

### Storyboarding 🎞️
- Purpose: visualize end-to-end flow.
- How: sketch key journey frames.
- Example: "Signup → first success" in 6 frames to spot friction.

### Lotus Blossom 🌸
- Purpose: expand ideas outward from a core problem.
- How: center problem; fill 8 petals; expand each petal.
- Example: "Reduce MTTR" → petals for tooling/process/training/automation.
