# Creative Problem Solver

## When to use
- Progress is stalled or blocked 🚧.
- Repeated attempts fail in the same way 🔁.
- The user asks for new angles, options, or "outside the box" ideas 💡.
- The problem is complex, tricky, tangled, or multi-constraint 🧩.
- The problem is novel, ambiguous, high-uncertainty, or cross-domain 🌪️.
- The team is circling the same constraints without new levers 🧱.

## Round contract (one turn per round)
- Deliver options, then stop and ask for human input before executing.
- Update the Knowledge Snapshot with new signals, constraints, and decisions.
- Record a Decision Log entry and Assumptions/Constraints list.

## Quick start
1. State why the current tactic fails (one sentence).
2. Reframe the constraint (use 1 technique from the Reframing toolkit).
3. Pick 1–3 techniques from the Library to generate options.
4. Propose the portfolio: Quick Win ⚡, Strategic Play 🎯, Transformative Move 🚀.
5. For each option, include: expected signal and escape hatch.
6. Score options (1–5) for Signal, Cost, Reversibility, Time.
7. Log decisions + assumptions/constraints.
8. Ask the user to choose or adjust constraints.
9. Close with an Insights Summary.

## Mode check
- Pragmatic Mode ✅ (default): ship-this-week options only.
- Visionary Mode 🌌: only when the user asks for long-term strategy or systemic change.

## Reframing toolkit
- Inversion: do the opposite of the current approach.
- Analogy transfer: map to a solved domain and borrow the pattern.
- Constraint extremes: set a key variable to zero or infinity.
- First principles: rebuild from basic facts, not inherited assumptions.

## Portfolio rule
Every response must include:
- Quick Win ⚡: smallest experiment that changes the information you have.
- Strategic Play 🎯: medium effort, leverages a structural advantage.
- Transformative Move 🚀: changes the system shape or assumptions.

## Option template
```
Quick Win ⚡:
- Expected signal:
- Escape hatch:

Strategic Play 🎯:
- Expected signal:
- Escape hatch:

Transformative Move 🚀:
- Expected signal:
- Escape hatch:
```

## Scoring rubric (simple 1–5, no weights)
Purpose: compare options quickly, not to compute a "correct" answer.
- Signal: how much new information this yields (1=low, 5=high).
- Cost: effort/complexity to try (1=low, 5=high).
- Reversibility: ease of undoing (1=hard, 5=easy).
- Time: elapsed time to learn (1=fast, 5=slow).

Prefer: high Signal, high Reversibility, low Cost, low Time.

## Ideation → prioritization workflow
1. Diverge: generate 10–30 ideas (no judging).
2. Cluster: group by theme or lever.
3. Score: apply the rubric.
4. Pick top 3 (one per portfolio tier).

## Technique Library (use 1–3 per round)
### Creative Problem Solving (CPS) Cycle 🧭
- Purpose: move from messy challenge to tested solution.
- How: Clarify → Ideate → Develop → Implement.
- Example: "Reduce churn" → clarify drivers, ideate 30 retention ideas, develop top 3 tests, implement one pilot.

### Brainstorming (Osborn rules) 🌊
- Purpose: flood the space with ideas.
- How: defer judgment, go for quantity, build on others, welcome wild ideas.
- Example: "Cut build time" → 20 wild ideas in 10 minutes before evaluating.

### Brainwriting 6-3-5 ✍️
- Purpose: generate lots of ideas quietly and quickly.
- How: 6 people, 3 ideas each, 5 rounds; pass ideas along.
- Example: "Improve onboarding" → 18–30 ideas without groupthink.

### SCAMPER 🔧
- Purpose: systematically transform an existing thing.
- How: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse.
- Example: "Faster code reviews" → Eliminate long templates, Combine review+test, Reverse by batching reviews.

### Six Thinking Hats 🎩
- Purpose: force parallel viewpoints.
- How: cycle hats (facts, emotions, risks, benefits, creativity, process).
- Example: "Adopt new framework" → run hats to separate risks from gut feel.

### TRIZ (Contradictions + 40 Principles) 🧪
- Purpose: resolve tradeoffs without compromise.
- How: express contradiction, pick principles that dissolve it.
- Example: "Increase performance without memory use" → apply "Segmentation" or "Dynamicity" to scope caches.

### Morphological Analysis 🧱
- Purpose: explore combinations across dimensions.
- How: define key parameters, list options for each, mix-and-match.
- Example: "New CLI" → axes: input, output, auth, mode; combine to surface novel designs.

### Synectics 🔗
- Purpose: use analogies to break patterns.
- How: direct analogy → personal analogy → symbolic analogy.
- Example: "Queue system" → think of a grocery line, then a beehive, then "breathing" to smooth surges.

### Lateral Thinking / Provocation (PO) ⚡
- Purpose: break linear assumptions with provocative moves.
- How: state a provocative idea, then extract a practical insight.
- Example: "No login at all" → learn that first-time use should be zero-friction.

### Random Stimulus / Random Word 🎲
- Purpose: force unexpected associations.
- How: pull a random word/image, map its properties to the problem.
- Example: Random word "bridge" → "bridge" as a guided handoff between steps.

### Forced Connections 🔀
- Purpose: connect unrelated concepts to spark ideas.
- How: pair two random items and ask "how could these connect?"
- Example: "Checkout flow + airport security" → pre-checklist, fast lanes, clear signage.

### Reverse Brainstorming 🔄
- Purpose: find failure modes, then invert them.
- How: ask "How do we make this worse?" then reverse answers.
- Example: "Make support slower" → identify delays, then remove them.

### Mind Mapping 🗺️
- Purpose: expand and organize idea space.
- How: central node → branches → sub-branches.
- Example: "Observability revamp" → branches for logs/metrics/traces/alerts.

### Affinity Diagramming 🧩
- Purpose: discover themes across many ideas.
- How: cluster notes without labels, then name clusters.
- Example: "User feedback" → cluster into onboarding, pricing, reliability.

### How Might We (HMW) ❓
- Purpose: reframe problems into solvable questions.
- How: convert a complaint into an HMW question.
- Example: "Deploys are scary" → "How might we make deploys feel reversible?"

### Design Thinking 🧠
- Purpose: build user-centric solutions.
- How: Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test.
- Example: "New admin UI" → shadow admins, define pain, prototype, test.

### Crazy 8s / Speedy Eights ✏️
- Purpose: produce rapid variations fast.
- How: 8 sketches in 8 minutes (or 4–8 minutes for 4–8 sketches).
- Example: "Dashboard layout" → 8 distinct layouts before discussing.

### Storyboarding 🎞️
- Purpose: visualize end-to-end flow.
- How: sketch key frames of the user journey.
- Example: "Signup → first success" in 6 frames to spot friction.

### Lotus Blossom 🌸
- Purpose: expand ideas from a core problem outward.
- How: center problem, fill 8 petals with ideas, then expand each petal.
- Example: "Reduce incident MTTR" → petals for tooling, process, training, automation.
