# Technique: Mind Mapping (externalize the space)

## One-liner
Expand and organize the problem space as a radial map to reveal clusters, gaps, and the next best reframe.

## Use when
- You feel cognitively overloaded (too many threads).
- You suspect missing stakeholders/constraints.
- You want to find the emptiest branch (often the real lever).

## Avoid when
- You already have many ideas and need convergence (use Affinity Diagramming).
- You need a crisp tradeoff escape (use TRIZ).

## Inputs
- Central problem statement.

## Procedure (fast, 5–8 min)
1. Put the problem in the center.
2. Create 5–7 first-order branches: stakeholders, causes, constraints, options, risks, signals.
3. Add 2–3 sub-branches per branch.
4. Identify the “thin” or “surprising” branch; pick it as the next reframe.

## Procedure (full, 15–25 min)
1. Branching pass (breadth)
   - Stakeholders: who experiences the pain / who can change the system.
   - Mechanisms: root causes, bottlenecks, feedback loops.
   - Constraints: hard vs soft constraints.
   - Options: candidate levers.
   - Signals: what would prove improvement.
   - Risks: what can go wrong.
2. Deepening pass (depth)
   - For each branch, ask “why / how / what else”.
3. Converge
   - Choose 1 branch as the dominant hypothesis.
   - Generate options targeting that branch.

## Prompt bank (copy/paste)
- “What stakeholders exist but aren’t represented here?”
- “Where are the feedback loops?”
- “What’s the bottleneck?”
- “What signal would change the plan?”
- “Which branch has the least detail (and why)?”

## Outputs (feed CPS portfolio)
- A structured map of the search space.
- A prioritized branch to target with experiments.

## Aha targets
- Discovering the problem is “permissions”, “tooling”, “incentives”, or “handoffs”, not “skill”.

## Pitfalls & defusals
- Pitfall: endless mapping → Defusal: timebox; stop when branches repeat.
- Pitfall: map stays descriptive → Defusal: translate one branch into actionable levers.

## Examples
### Engineering
Problem: slow onboarding.
Branches: environments, permissions, docs, tooling, sample data, mentorship.
Aha: permissions branch is thin → likely bottleneck.
Option: pre-provision roles + automated access request; signal: time-to-first-PR.

### Mixed domain
Problem: feeling overwhelmed.
Branches: obligations, energy, boundaries, routines, support.
Aha: boundaries branch is thin → missing constraint setting.
Option: define ‘no-meeting blocks’; signal: weekly stress rating; escape hatch: adjust blocks if collaboration suffers.
