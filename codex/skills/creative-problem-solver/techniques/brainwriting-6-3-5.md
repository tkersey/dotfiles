# Technique: Brainwriting 6-3-5 (quiet divergence)

## One-liner
Quiet idea generation that reduces groupthink: 6 participants × 3 ideas × 5 minutes × 6 rounds ≈ 108 ideas in ~30 minutes (adaptable solo).

## Use when
- Discussion is dominated by loud voices or status dynamics.
- You want breadth without debate.
- You need creative combinations (building on prior ideas).

## Avoid when
- You only have one participant and no time (use Oblique Draw / Random Stimulus).
- The key difficulty is a contradiction (use TRIZ).

## Inputs
- Prompt: one sentence (best as “How might we…”).
- A “round” mechanism (timer; a document).

## Procedure (group)
1. Set prompt + constraints.
2. Round 1 (5 min): each person writes 3 ideas.
3. Pass (or rotate the document).
4. Repeat rounds (typically 4–6): build on what you received; do not critique.
5. Converge: cluster ideas; pick 5–10; harden into experiments.

## Procedure (solo adaptation)
1. Do 3 rounds of 5 minutes:
   - Round 1: 3 ideas.
   - Round 2: 3 variations on *prior* ideas (mutate, combine, invert).
   - Round 3: 3 “wild” ideas (ignore feasibility).
2. Converge: pick 3; rewrite as experiments (signal + escape hatch).

## Prompt bank (copy/paste)
- “Write 3 ideas that reduce X while preserving Y.”
- “Write 3 ideas that change the unit of work.”
- “Write 3 ideas that remove a step.”
- “Write 3 ideas that exploit existing assets (skills, data, tools).”

## Outputs (feed CPS portfolio)
- A large, debate-free idea pool.
- Natural “chains” of improvements (idea → variant → hybrid).

## Aha targets
- Unexpected hybrids (“we can do both” patterns).
- Discovering a new constraint lever (“we can change the unit; then it’s easy”).

## Pitfalls & defusals
- Pitfall: participants critique as they write → Defusal: rule: no evaluation, only generation.
- Pitfall: ideas repeat → Defusal: add a constraint per round (e.g., “must be reversible”).
- Pitfall: output never converges → Defusal: timebox convergence; select one idea per theme.

## Examples
### Engineering
Prompt: “How might we reduce production incidents without slowing delivery?”
- Brainwrite: rollout patterns, observability, guardrails, automated checks.
- Converge: 3 experiments: canary + error-budget alerts + flake quarantine.

### Mixed domain
Prompt: “How might we increase exercise consistency without relying on motivation?”
- Brainwrite: habit cues, friction reduction, social commitment, tiny routines.
- Converge: experiment: ‘2-minute rule’ + pre-packed gear; signal: days exercised; escape hatch: adjust routine length if adherence drops.
