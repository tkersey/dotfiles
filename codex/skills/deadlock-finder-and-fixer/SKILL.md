# Deadlock Finder and Fixer

> **Core Insight.** Concurrency bugs do not come from one missing lock — they come from **one lock acquired in the wrong place, at the wrong time, held across the wrong operation, by a thread that didn't know it was holding it.** Find every instance of the hazard, not just the one that fired.

> **The Universal Rule.** When you think you found the deadlock and fixed the three instances you could see, **there is almost always a fourth**. This is the single most common failure mode across every concurrency debugging session in this repo's history. Keep searching until you can prove exhaustively — by code audit — that no hazard remains. See [THE FOURTH INSTANCE](references/THE-FOURTH-INSTANCE.md).

## Quick Start: Something Is Hung

```bash
# 1. Is it CPU-alive or CPU-dead?
ps -Lp $PID -o tid,pcpu,pmem,comm --no-headers | head -20

# 2. Snapshot all thread states (pick ONE, in order of availability):
gdb --batch -ex "set pagination off" -ex "thread apply all bt full" -p $PID 2>&1 | tee /tmp/bt.txt
#   OR (if ptrace blocked / LD_PRELOAD hazard):
strace -k -f -p $PID 2>&1 | head -200
#   OR (sample /proc):
for i in 1 2 3; do cat /proc/$PID/task/*/stack 2>/dev/null | sort -u; sleep 1; done

# 3. Classify (pick the matching row from the Symptom Triage Table below).
# 4. Jump to the matching section in this skill or in gdb-for-debugging.
```

**Diagnosis depth is in [gdb-for-debugging](../gdb-for-debugging/SKILL.md)** — which already contains the Lock Graph Construction algorithm, mutex ownership inspector, async runtime analysis, and TSAN/rr workflow. **This skill is the complement**: it covers *taxonomy*, *static-audit discovery*, *fix catalog*, and *prevention by design* — the parts that don't need a running process.

## The Nine Classes (Taxonomy)

### Class 1 — Classic Mutex Deadlock

**Definition:** Two or more threads each hold a lock the other needs; circular wait in the lock-wait graph.

**Canonical forms:**
- **AB-BA:** T1 holds A, wants B; T2 holds B, wants A.
- **Self-deadlock:** Single thread re-enters the same non-recursive mutex (e.g., callback path re-enters lock holder).
- **Reader-upgrade:** Thread holds `RwLock::read`, then asks for `RwLock::write` in the same thread → guaranteed hang.
- **Condvar wakeup loop:** Thread in `pthread_cond_wait` on `M`; its waker needs to acquire `M` to signal but can't.

**How to spot at rest (static audit):** search for any function that acquires two distinct mutexes, verify all call paths acquire them in the *same order* everywhere. Any deviation is a latent deadlock. See [STATIC-AUDIT.md](references/STATIC-AUDIT.md) for ast-grep recipes.

**How to spot at runtime:** see gdb-for-debugging §"Lock Graph Construction & Deadlock Proof". The algorithm: identify all threads in `__lll_lock_wait`, read the `__owner` field on each contested `pthread_mutex_t` to build the wait-for graph, find a cycle.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Total lock order.** Assign every mutex a global rank; assert in debug builds that locks are only acquired in ascending order. `parking_lot::deadlock` detector can enforce this at runtime.
- **Lock coalescing.** Replace two separate mutexes with one covering both pieces of state if they're always used together.
- **Critical-section shrinking.** Copy needed data out, release the lock, then do the work without it.
- **Don't hold a lock across a call you don't own.** Never call user callbacks, foreign functions, or allocator hooks while holding a lock — they may re-enter.

### Class 2 — Async / `.await` Deadlocks

**Definition:** The logical task graph has a cycle, or a task that holds a non-`.await`-aware lock yields to the runtime and is never re-polled because the next task needs the same lock.

**Canonical forms:**
- **`std::sync::Mutex` held across `.await`.** The guard crosses the yield point; the task is parked with the lock still held; another task needs the lock and blocks the worker thread.
- **`block_on` inside an async runtime.** Runtime thread enters a synchronous wait; the thing it's waiting for needs the runtime to make progress.
- **`spawn_blocking` missing** (or misused for sync I/O from async context).
- **Channel cycle.** Task A sends to a bounded channel whose reader is Task B; Task B sends to a bounded channel whose reader is Task A; both blocked on full/empty.
- **JoinHandle cycle.** Task A `.await`s B's handle; B `.await`s A's.
- **Task starvation.** A long-running task on a tokio-runtime-worker monopolizes the thread; other tasks cannot be polled. Looks like a deadlock to the end user.

**Signature at rest:** `grep` the codebase for `let guard = lock.lock(); ... .await` and `std::sync::Mutex` inside `async fn`. Use the recipes in [STATIC-AUDIT.md](references/STATIC-AUDIT.md) — this is the highest-ROI static check you can run on an async Rust codebase.

**Signature at runtime:** workers idle in `epoll_wait`, but requests pending. See gdb-for-debugging §"Diagnosing Async Deadlocks".

**Fix catalog:**
- **Drop the guard before `.await`.** Explicitly: `let data = { let g = lock.lock(); g.clone() }; do_io(data).await;`.
- **Use `tokio::sync::Mutex`** only when you *must* hold the lock across `.await`. It is slower — prefer dropping the guard.
- **`spawn_blocking` for synchronous I/O** from an async context (synchronous SQLite, `std::fs::read`, CPU-heavy work, C library calls).
- **Replace shared state with channels.** Actors own their state; requests arrive via `mpsc`; replies via `oneshot`. No shared mutex, no lock-order bugs.
- **Bound channels carefully.** Unbounded is a memory leak; bounded risks backpressure deadlock if the sender can't make progress without the receiver running. When in doubt, prefer `try_send` + drop-oldest policy.
- **Never `block_on` inside an async context.** If you must bridge, use `Handle::current().spawn_blocking(...)` or restructure to avoid the bridge.

### Class 3 — Livelock / Retry Storms

**Definition:** Threads make visible activity (`futex_wake` + `futex_wait`, high CPU, log noise) but **no forward progress**. Often mistaken for a deadlock.

**Canonical forms:**
- **Retry-on-BUSY without backoff.** N workers hit a contended resource, all retry immediately, none wins.
- **Condvar ping-pong.** Two threads repeatedly wake each other on edges that are no longer true.
- **Accept-loop without backoff.** `accept4` returns `EAGAIN`, immediately retried; no poll, no sleep.
- **ABA in a lock-free structure.** CAS succeeds on a value that was swapped out and back in; the operation corrupts state; other threads undo and retry.

**Signature:** 100% CPU, `strace` shows a tight loop of the same syscall, logs show retry messages stacked.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Exponential backoff with jitter.** Every retry loop must have it. No exceptions.
- **Single-writer pattern.** Serialize writes to a contested resource through one owner; readers proceed in parallel.
- **Fairness / queue-based locks.** `parking_lot` is unfair by default; switch to `fair()` if starvation is observed.
- **Convert edge-triggered notifications to level-triggered.** Store the *desired state*, not the *transition*; the consumer can always recompute.

### Class 4 — Database Concurrency (SQLite-heavy)

**The recurring pain points across our projects:**

1. **`SQLITE_BUSY` / "database is locked".** Multiple connections want the write lock simultaneously. The loser fails.
2. **WAL checkpoint starvation.** Long-running readers prevent the WAL from being reset; writes continue to append; DB size explodes.
3. **Connection-per-request with shared file.** Every connection sees its own lock state; a long transaction in one blocks every other. Connection pool can hide the problem or make it worse.
4. **Async blocking on sync driver.** `rusqlite::Connection` is synchronous; using it from an async handler without `spawn_blocking` blocks the runtime thread.
5. **PRAGMA left at defaults.** No `busy_timeout`, no `journal_mode=WAL`, no `synchronous=NORMAL`. Every writer serializes with exclusive locks and no retry.
6. **Transaction escalation.** `BEGIN` followed by a read followed by a write upgrades the lock; another writer that's already in a write transaction now deadlocks.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Set PRAGMAs on every connection open:**
  ```sql
  PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
  PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL;
  PRAGMA busy_timeout = 5000;     -- ms; SQLite will retry internally
  PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;
  PRAGMA temp_store = MEMORY;
  PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456;
  ```
- **One writer connection, many reader connections.** Serialize all writes through a single `Mutex<Connection>` or a single actor task. Readers can use a pool.
- **`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` for transactions that will write.** Acquires the write lock up-front; prevents deferred-to-immediate upgrade deadlocks.
- **Outer retry on `SQLITE_BUSY` with exponential backoff + jitter**, on top of the internal `busy_timeout`.
- **Checkpoint explicitly.** `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` on a schedule or after bulk writes so WAL doesn't grow unbounded.
- **From async: always wrap sync SQLite calls in `spawn_blocking`.** Or use `sqlx`/`tokio-rusqlite` which do it for you.

See [DATABASE.md](references/DATABASE.md) for the full WAL semantics reference, PRAGMA matrix, retry-with-backoff Rust template, and project-sourced incident reports.

### Class 5 — Runtime-Init / Reentrant Hazards

**Definition:** Code that runs during early process/library initialization acquires a lock, and something on the init path re-enters the same lock (or a lock held by the loader itself).

**The canonical case from `glibc_rust`:** `libglibc_rs_abi.so` exports `strlen`. When loaded via `LD_PRELOAD`, the dynamic loader calls `strlen` during symbol resolution. `strlen` calls into the membrane crate, which touches a `OnceLock` holding global policy. `OnceLock::get_or_init` takes a lock. The allocator inside `get_or_init` also goes through the same libc and re-enters the ABI. **Reentrant lock on a non-recursive primitive → infinite hang.**

**The broader rule:** *Any* function that may be called before `main` — or by a library interposition — **cannot** use `OnceLock`, `std::sync::Mutex`, `lazy_static`, `RwLock`, or the allocator. All of these can block.

**Static-audit signature:**
```bash
ast-grep run -l Rust -p '$X::get_or_init($$$)'
rg -n 'OnceLock|OnceCell|Lazy|lazy_static|thread_local!' crates/<preload_lib>/
```
Every hit is a potential hazard in an LD_PRELOAD context.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Atomic state machine instead of `OnceLock`.** Encode `{UNINIT=0, INIT_IN_PROGRESS=1, INIT_DONE=2}` in an `AtomicU8`; race losers spin-wait briefly (rare path) or fall back to a null-safe default.
- **Compile-time constant initialization** wherever possible (`const fn`, `static`).
- **Deferred initialization.** Don't initialize on first call; initialize lazily only on paths that are safe (after `main`).
- **Signal-safety:** forbid allocation and locks in any code path that might run from a signal handler. This is the same class of hazard.
- **Test via `LD_PRELOAD` the binary against a small program that calls every exported function; any hang means reentrant init.**

See [LD-PRELOAD.md](references/LD-PRELOAD.md) for the full incident + fix narrative from glibc-rust/frankenlibc sessions.

### Class 6 — Data Races & TOCTOU

**Definition:** Unsynchronized concurrent access to the same memory; one of the accesses is a write. In a language with a defined memory model (Rust, Go, Java, C11+), this is undefined behavior.

**TOCTOU (time-of-check-to-time-of-use):** Check a condition, then act on it, assuming it's still true. It isn't.

**Discovery:** TSAN is ground truth. `RUSTFLAGS="-Zsanitizer=thread" cargo +nightly build ...` then run the test suite with high concurrency. For Go: `go test -race`. For C/C++: `-fsanitize=thread`.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Wrap shared state in `Mutex` / `RwLock` / `Atomic`.** The compiler enforces this in Rust; listen to it.
- **Replace shared state with channels / message passing.**
- **For counters: `AtomicUsize` with `Ordering::Relaxed` only if you've read the memory-ordering rules; otherwise `SeqCst`. Err on the side of stronger.**
- **For TOCTOU: eliminate the gap.** Use atomic `compare_exchange`, transactional updates, or hold the lock across check + action.

See gdb-for-debugging §"Race Condition Methodology" for the reproduce → detect → localize → fix → verify loop.

### Class 7 — Multi-Process / Swarm Races

**Definition:** Multiple processes (or agents) contend for a shared resource — a file, a database, a tmux session, a git working tree — without in-process synchronization.

**Our typical forms:**
- **Two agents editing the same file.** Agent A writes, Agent B writes; one overwrites the other's work.
- **Advisory lease expiry.** An agent takes a file reservation with TTL=3600, runs longer, lease expires, another agent takes it; original finishes and writes over the new work.
- **Cross-process SQLite.** Solved by Class 4 techniques *plus* `PRAGMA locking_mode=NORMAL` (not `EXCLUSIVE`).
- **tmux mux server wedged.** A child process holds an fd the mux needs; the mux blocks on I/O; every pane hangs.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Use MCP Agent Mail file reservations.** See [agent-mail](../agent-mail/SKILL.md). `file_reservation_paths` with an appropriate TTL + a `reason` tying back to the bead/task. Release explicitly; don't rely on TTL.
- **`flock(2)` for filesystem-only coordination.** Advisory, cooperative. Every consumer must call it.
- **Single-writer process for the DB.** Other processes submit work via a queue or RPC.
- **Monitor mux health.** `wezterm-mux-server` is sacred — protect it explicitly (see system-performance-remediation).

### Class 8 — Poisoning & Partial State

**Definition:** A thread panics while holding a `Mutex`. Rust's `std::sync::Mutex` poisons the mutex; subsequent `.lock()` calls return `Err(PoisonError)`. If the panic left shared state partially updated, *every* caller must now decide: trust or discard.

**Fix catalog:**
- **`parking_lot::Mutex` does not poison.** It's faster and simpler, but callers must handle partial state explicitly.
- **Treat every critical section as a transaction.** Build the new state in a local, then swap atomically at the end. A panic mid-build leaves the shared state untouched.
- **Catch-unwind at the task boundary.** If a task panics, let the runtime notice and restart it; don't let the panic propagate through shared state.

### Class 9 — Memory Ordering & Lost Wakeups

**Definition:** Correct locks, incorrect assumptions about visibility or ordering. The observed behavior seems to violate program order — because it does, on the CPU's reordered view.

**Canonical forms:**
- **Wake-before-wait.** Thread A stores a flag, signals condvar; Thread B hasn't entered wait yet; signal is lost.
- **Lost notification on an edge.** Use of `Notify::notify_one` before `notified().await` — the notification is dropped.
- **Wrong memory ordering.** `Ordering::Relaxed` on a pointer publication — reader sees a garbage object because the initializer store hasn't become visible.

**Fix catalog:**
- **Always pair a condvar with a predicate.** `while !ready { cv.wait(lock) }`. Never `if`.
- **Store the predicate before signaling.** Signal *after* the condition is true.
- **Prefer tokio `Notify` with `notified()` set up *before* the event can happen** (see Tokio `Notify` docs — the `notified()` future must be polled at least once to subscribe).
- **Use `Ordering::Release` for the producer store and `Ordering::Acquire` for the consumer load** when publishing a pointer / building an atomic state machine. Never `Relaxed` for data publication.

## The Discovery Playbook

When a bug has been reported:

1. **Capture state before touching anything.** gdb `thread apply all bt full` → file. Once the process dies, the evidence is gone.
2. **Classify using the Symptom Triage Table.** Jump to the matching class above.
3. **Build the lock-wait graph** (gdb-for-debugging §Lock Graph). Prove the deadlock exists before you "fix" it — guessing is how you get four more of them.
4. **Fix the root cause, not the symptom.** A timeout on a deadlocked `.lock()` is a smoke alarm, not a fire extinguisher.
5. **Audit for the other three.** Every deadlock you find is a sample from a distribution. Run the static-audit recipes to find the rest. See [THE FOURTH INSTANCE](references/THE-FOURTH-INSTANCE.md).
6. **Add a regression test.** Stress tests with `--test-threads=N` and `loom` (Rust) or `go test -race`. Fuzz the scheduler with `rr --chaos` if you have it.

When doing a preemptive audit (no bug reported yet):

1. **Run the static audit recipes** ([STATIC-AUDIT.md](references/STATIC-AUDIT.md)) — ast-grep + ripgrep across the codebase for every pattern in the nine classes.
2. **Enable `parking_lot` deadlock detection** in debug builds; run the test suite. Any detection is a proof of deadlock.
3. **Run TSAN** on the test suite.
4. **Run `loom`** (if Rust) on the core concurrency primitives of the project.
5. **Review every `unsafe impl Send/Sync`.** Each one is a hand-written promise the compiler couldn't check.

---

## Static Audit Recipes (High-ROI Greps)

See [STATIC-AUDIT.md](references/STATIC-AUDIT.md) for the full catalog. Highlights:

```bash
# Rust: guard held across await (manual inspection required)
rg -n --type rust -U 'let\s+\w+\s*=\s*.*\.(lock|read|write)\(\).*\n[^}]*\.await' .

# Rust: std::sync::Mutex inside async fn (smell)
ast-grep run -l Rust -p 'async fn $F($$$) { $$$ std::sync::Mutex $$$ }'

# Rust: block_on inside anywhere (double-check: may be inside a sync bridge)
rg -n --type rust 'block_on' .

# Rust: OnceLock / Lazy in LD_PRELOAD libs (Class 5)
rg -n --type rust 'OnceLock|OnceCell|Lazy::new|lazy_static!|thread_local!' crates/<preload>/

# Two different lock orderings in the same code (Class 1)
rg -n --type rust 'let\s+\w+\s*=\s*self\.\w+\.lock\(\)' . | sort -u

# SQLite: missing busy_timeout (Class 4)
rg -n 'Connection::open|open_in_memory' . | rg -v 'busy_timeout'

# Rust: unbounded channel (Class 2 back-pressure risk)
rg -n 'unbounded_channel|mpsc::unbounded' --type rust .

# Missing fairness on rwlock (Class 3)
rg -n 'RwLock::new' --type rust .  # review each for writer-starvation risk
```

## Fix Catalog (Canonical Replacements)

See [FIX-CATALOG.md](references/FIX-CATALOG.md). Summary:

| Broken Pattern | Replace With | Why |
|----------------|--------------|-----|
| `OnceLock` on LD_PRELOAD path | `AtomicU8` state machine | No allocator, no reentrancy |
| `std::sync::Mutex` held across `.await` | Scoped guard dropped before `.await` | Task yield with lock is a bug |
| Deep call holding two locks | Total lock order + assertion | Eliminate cycle possibility |
| Retry-on-BUSY tight loop | Exponential backoff + jitter | Break livelock |
| Connection-per-request SQLite | Single writer, read pool | Prevent lock escalation storms |
| Shared `Mutex<Vec<Work>>` | `mpsc::channel` + actor | No lock for producers |
| `lazy_static` in `LD_PRELOAD` | `const` / compile-time init | No lock needed |
| `std::Mutex` + panic risk | `parking_lot::Mutex` + transaction-style updates | No poisoning, clearer semantics |
| `flock` only in-process | `flock` + app-level lease + TTL | Multi-process coordination |

---

## Prevention by Design

1. **Prefer message passing over shared state.** An actor with a private mutable state + mpsc inbox has zero lock-ordering bugs, by construction.
2. **Single writer, many readers.** Most of our DB and state-sharing incidents would not have happened if writes were serialized through one owner.
3. **Ranks for locks.** Assign a total order; assert ascending acquisition. Loom or parking_lot can check in tests.
4. **Bound every queue / channel.** Unbounded is a leak; explicit bounds force you to reason about backpressure.
5. **Time-bound every wait.** `try_lock_for(Duration)` over `.lock()`; `timeout(Duration, fut).await` over bare `.await`. Every hang becomes a log line, not a stall.
6. **Encapsulate; don't share handles to shared state.** Give callers a method that does the operation, not a guard.
7. **Fix the worst class first.** By volume of pain across our incidents, the ranking is: **Class 4 (DB) > Class 2 (async) > Class 5 (runtime init) > Class 7 (swarm) > Class 1 (classic)**. Look at your own codebase and adjust.

## Validation

Before you declare a concurrency fix done:

- [ ] **Reproduce reliably**, or accept that you can't and run the fix past stress + TSAN + loom.
- [ ] **Add a test** that would have caught it: `#[test]` with `--test-threads=N`, or `loom::model`, or a stress harness with N=100× the old workload.
- [ ] **Run the static audit** ([STATIC-AUDIT.md](references/STATIC-AUDIT.md)) and find every other instance of the same hazard.
- [ ] **Document the fix in commit/bead** so future-you knows what you changed and why.
- [ ] **parking_lot deadlock_detection on** in debug builds; run tests; no detections.
- [ ] **TSAN clean** on the test suite (Rust/C/Go).
- [ ] **`loom::model`** passes for the critical primitive if Rust.
